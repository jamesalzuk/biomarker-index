Braincheck ,BrainCheck inc ,https://www.braincheck.com/,App,"BrainCheck is an iOS app which is open to the public. It is comprised of a series of tests which are said to detect cognitive impairment. It has two separate programmes, a sport and a memory programme. The sport programme is aimed at detecting signs of concussion and the memory programme is used to detect any signs of cognitive impairment. The tests are immediate and delayed recall, the Stroop test, digital symbol substitution test and trail test A and B. The tests take about 10 minutes to complete and produce results as a point on a scale. There is no quantitative value for each result. There are 5 results produced which signify cognitive processing, executive function, visual attention and immediate and delayed recall. The scale goes from low to high with an intermediate bar indicating the average range. It is hard to interpret the results as they don’t say exactly what is meant by the measurements. The tests are easy to understand but could be subject to the practise effect, especially as this app is open to the public. This app has been used in clinical studies, specifically related to dementia. A study in 2019 found that BrainCheck is a significant tool for measuring cognitive impairment in older adults and that the scores significantly correlated with scores on the SLUMS, MMSE, MoCA tests and a physician’s diagnosis. They suggest that this software still needs future research into its ability as a whole to detect mild cognitive impairment as well as dementia (Groppell et al., 2019). Overall, this app has the potential to be used in early detection of dementia as it analyses many areas linked to impairment in dementia and it is cheap and easy to use.

Phonak ,Phonak ,https://www.phonak.com/uk/en/online-hearing-test.html,Online hearing test ,"Phonak is a website which has a free online hearing test. This test is a mix of
listening to noises and answering questions about experiences with noise. The
listening section of the test analyses how good an individual’s hearing is at
processing different pitches. The test presents a low then medium then high
pitched noise and requires the participant to adjust the volume using displayed
buttons until they can just barely hear the sound. After this section it asks
the following questions:

· Do you have problems understanding
conversations one to one?

· In conversations do people seem to mumble.

· Do you have problems hearing high pitched
sounds like birds singing?

· Do you have trouble hearing people in noisy
environments?

To these questions the responses are, always, often, sometimes, rarely and never. This test isn’t meant to replace a hearing test;
however, it does give some insight into the condition of a person’s hearing.
The issue with this test is that it doesn’t have any clinical validation, the
results are qualitative and there isn’t a way to track hearing in a simple way,
instead the patient would have to keep note of all the results manually.
Although this test is free and easy to administer within the home there are
limitations which could prevent it from potentially being used in early
detection of dementia.

This portable audiometry set includes a pair of specialised headphones which connect to a laptop and perform a hearing test. The technology behind these headphones means that the test can be performed without need for a specialised sound booth as its design limits background noise to gold standard levels. The performance of this hearing test requires another individual to be present. This additional individual must undergo minimal training in how to use the device however the test is automatic. The tester must observe the software to make sure abnormalities don’t occur and that ambient noise doesn’t get too loud, but they aren’t needed for the completion of the actual test. Once the test is completed a report is generated which gives all the information required about the persons hearing and can be given to a clinician. Even though this piece of technology is expensive it can be reused. The device comes with replaceable ear buds and there is an inbuilt calibrator meaning each test is accurate for each patient. This device could be used within the GPs office for multiple patients and only requires a one-time payment. Training is also provided for free and provides certification. The difference in the plus from the prime is that it comes with a bone conduction attachment.

The MTw Awinda Research bundle which is one of their offerings includes six wireless motion trackers, a recording and docking station, receiving dongle, a full body strap set, software development kit and a suitcase to allow storage and transport.",Active,static,Full body,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,requested,requested,1,0.5,0,0,

CANTAB connect research ,Cambridge cognition ,https://www.cambridgecognition.com/home,Cognitive test software ,"CANTAB connect research is a device developed by Cambridge cognition. This technology is based around CNTAB software but is designed specifically for researchers. The CANTAB software consists of several tests which evaluate different aspects of cognitive function. CANTAB connect research utilises these tests with the full battery containing 17 tests. These tests are administered on a compatible iPad and come in 46 languages. The test themselves are fully automatic with instructions built in so intervention of clinicians is not required. This device also has an additional feature, web-based testing. This means people can complete the tests at home on their own computer or iPad. This device has been clinical validated being published in over 2,300 peer reviewed papers and cited in over 100,000 high impact publications. Overall, this technology has a lot of depth and accuracy when analysing cognition, a simple data link to researchers and can be self-administered. If this device was openly available within health care, it would be very promising for early detection of dementia.",Active,static,Non-wearable,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"*CANTAB connect research pricing is based on the number of assessments purchased and how many tests are included. For the full access to all the tests the pricing starts off at £24 per assessment for 50 assessments. There is no maximum, however for example if 1000 assessments were purchased the price per assessment would decrease to £15. There is also the option to only purchase between 1-8 tests. This makes the price per assessment for 50 assessments £14.77 and £9.23 when buying 1000 assessments. ",,,,,***CANTAB connect research has the ability to be accessed through the web. This means that the tests are available to send via email to the participants of the study meaning they dont need to attend the GP ,
CANTAB mobile ,Cambridge cognition ,https://www.cambridgecognition.com/home,Cognitive test application ,"Cambridge cognition have developed this device specifically for integration into healthcare. It is an iPad-based battery test which takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and is designed for adults aged 50+. The technology is CE-marked, FDA-cleared and TGA approved as a medical device. The use of this device has been linked to identifying early signs of memory problems specified as potential risk factors of AD. Unlike the CANTAB connect research this device cannot perform web-based testing. It is limited to one tablet and so must be completed by the physician who purchase the software. However, this device is portable, so clinicians do have the ability to perform the test within the patient’s home, but they need to be present.",Active,static,Non-wearable,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,**CANTAB mobile pricing is based on the length of time you require the license. To purchase the software for 1 month it would cost £84. Like CANTAB connect research it doesnt have a maximum however an example of a longer time would be 2 years for £2000. This license gives you unlimited assessments for that time period ,,0.5,0.5,1,0,
