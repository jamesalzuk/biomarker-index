Wakefulness,"Wakefulness is a term describing the awareness level of an individual. It changes throughout the day, typically reducing at night, when a person is asleep, and increasing when a person is awake and engaged. In those living with Dementia with Lewy Bodies, the normal wakefulness cycle is significantly affected. This means measures of wakefulness can be used to detect the possibility of dementia development. Wakefulness is controlled by parts of the brain such as the locus coeruleus (LC). The LC is a nucleus which consists of many noradrenergic neurons. The main function of this nucleus is to supply the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord with noradrenaline (Counts and Mufson, 2013). This supply interacts with areas of the brain to affect the wakefulness-sleep state. 

For example, the LC innervates an area of the brainstem called the dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus. The DR is involved in the regulation of wakefulness-sleep state, specifically firing its neurons extensively during wakefulness. This affect is due to the excitatory signal from the LC neurons (Samuels and Szabadi, 2008). The LC is also involved in the promotion and inhibition of wakefulness through its interaction with the ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) area. Within the hypothalamus. The VLPO, when active, inhibits the action of an area called the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), an area which sends histamine projections to the cerebral cortex promoting wakefulness. The LC supplies the VLPO with noradrenaline which binds to 2-adrenoreceptors, inhibiting VLPO neurons. This inhibition means the TMN can carry out its function resulting in a high wakefulness state. The VLPO is only seen to be highly active during slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep, when wakefulness is very low (Samuels and Szabadi, 2008). 

A high density of Lewy Bodies is normally found within the locus coeruleus of DLB patients. These affect the wakefulness-sleep state of the individual during the day and night which is shown through the presence of symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness and fluctuations in consciousness (Grace, Walker and McKeith, 2000).  

Another explanation for the abnormal changes seen in the wakefulness-sleep state of individuals with DLB could be due to damage of the SCN or its connections. The circadian rhythm is the central circadian pacemaker in the brain (Hastings, Maywood and Brancaccio, 2019), it is responsible for maintaining the sleep-wake cycle. The characteristics of wakefulness in DLB patients appears to be opposite to a cognitively normal person. This is shown by excessive tiredness in the day and insomnia. These symptoms could be due to the impairment of the SCN altering the circadian rhythm so that it is backwards. ",DLB,Sleep behaviour
RBD,"RBD is a parasomnia that involves the acting out of dreams during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This symptom is thought to be part of the prodromal stage of diseases such as DLB. The exact percentage of DLB patients which have RBD has been debated, with some studies saying it 40% whereas others have specified as high as 74%. Although there is a difference there is a consensus that the two disorders are related. There is also evidence which suggests that both RBD and DLB arise due to the same underlying synucleinopathy. One of the main features of RBD is the loss of muscle atonia. Muscle atonia is the inhibition of muscular activity, except middle ear muscles and the muscles that control eye movement. During normal REM sleep it is the responsibility of the sublateral dorsal/subcoerulus nucleus to stimulate a series of neurological events which result in the inhibition of the spinal motor neuron pool, causing REM sleep atonia. The failure in this system means that the individual can perform the abnormal behaviours seen in RBD. Although not noted it could be possible that the presence of Lewy bodies can prevent this system from functioning properly.

There have been specific links between neurological processes and DLB, for example the links with the LC, substantia nigra (SN), and the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). The neuronal loss seen in DLB occurs in the LC and SN, which alongside dysregulation of cholinergic neurons in the PPN is said to increase REM sleep drive and more importantly RBD (Chan et al., 2018). The SN is a dopaminergic nucleus found in the midbrain. It receives input from the PPN and projects to the putamen along the nigrostriatal pathway (Sonne and Beato, 2018). The putamen is an area of the brain involved in a complex feedback loop which aids in the movement of limbs (Healthline, 2015). The presence of Lewy bodies in these structures could affect the effectiveness of these pathways which could explain the abnormal movement in RBD. Overall, RBD is recommended as a good marker for early detection as previous studies have shown that between 38% and 65% of RBD patients go on to develop an alpha-synucleinopathy, such as DLB, 10-20 years after the individuals starts experiencing RBD (Chan et al., 2018).   ",AD,Sleep behaviour
Sundowning,"Sundowning is a phenomenon that occurs when the sun goes down and is characterised by increased agitation and worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms. This behaviour has lots of evidentiary support for its link to AD (Grace, Walker and McKeith, 2000) however, it has also been seen to occur in patients with vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and DLB. Although this affect does not have a definite cause there is a large amount of evidence to suggest it occurs due to changes in the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is regulated by an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Canevelli et al., 2016) The SCN controls the circadian rhythm by stimulating and supressing the release of key hormones. These hormones include melatonin and cortisol (National Sleep Foundation, 2018) which have been specifically observed to change in AD patients. Melatonin is released at night and aids in sleep. Its release is affected by exposure to light, which is seen by melatonin suppression during pupil dilation. This explains the release at night when the sun sets and light levels decrease (Society of endocrinology, 2018). Cortisol levels also change due to AD and it is hypothesised that this is due to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which has been related to pathogenesis of sundowning (Canevelli et al., 2016). A hypothalamic region called the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) secretes a hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone which interacts with the anterior pituitary, releasing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH acts on the adrenal cortex to release cortisol (Bradley Bush, ND, and Tori Hudson, 2016). The alteration of this axis could explain the significant increase in cortisol found in AD patients. The change in cortisol levels paired with the reduced melatonin levels in these patients could explain the abnormal behaviours seen in sundowning.","AD, DLB, FTD, VD",Sleep behaviour
Sleep apnoea,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a disorder defined by the stopping of breathing during the night due to periodic blocking of the airway. It has recently been strongly linked to AD due to the presence of the established AD biomarker tau protein. This link was made during a study which found that people presenting with OSA had 4.5% higher accumulation of tau protein in the area of the brain responsible for memory (Carvalho et al., 2019) A meta-analysis was also conducted in 2016 which analysed published clinical data linking sleep apnoea and AD. The analysis found that people with AD had a 5 times higher chance of having OSA. In addition to this they also stated that having OSA meant a person was more at risk of developing AD within the following decade. Finally, they also highlighted a study which found that in a community of 298 women those with OSA were more likely to be diagnosed by the next follow up in 5 years (Emamian et al., 2016) These elements show that sleep apnoea could be used as a good biomarker for dementia, specifically AD.","AD, VD",Sleep behaviour
Insomnia,"Vascular dementia has a similar sleep profile to other types of dementia, including presenting with OSA and having insomnia. However, the difference between vascular dementia and other dementia types is that patient with VD patients show signs of insomnia at a 1.5 to 2.5 higher frequency than AD and frontotemporal dementia patients. For vascular dementia specifically these sleep disturbances are linked to white matter hypersensitivity severity with most relating to daytime hypersomnolence (Cipriani et al., 2015).  

Frontotemporal dementia can be subdivided into behaviour variant FTD (bvFTD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA). These two subtypes show differences during sleep. Patients with PPA are more likely to have disrupted sleep compared to bvFTD patients. Insomnia was found to be present in 48% of FTD patients but the cause has been disputed between studies. One study links the cause to phase delay and increased nocturnal motor activity, whilst others have concluded it is due to phase advanced rhythm (Harper et al., 2001; Anderson et al., 2009; McCarter, St. Louis and Boeve, 2016)These differences have been noted in comparison to AD which means that these subtypes of dementia can be distinguished. Imaging techniques have been used to investigate the causes and have found severe neuronal loss in the basal forebrain and the hippocampus. PSG studies have also found an elevated apnoea-hypopnea index in FTD patients compared to non-impaired individuals. Finally, it has also been suggested that orexin deficiency observed in impaired patients may contribute to fragmented sleep (McCarter, St. Louis and Boeve, 2016)","VD, AD, FTD",Sleep behaviour
Disorientation,"Disorientation in dementia is the word used to describe the mental confusion commonly experienced by patients. This confusion can be seen during the retrieval of information from an individual where instead of accurate and correct response they provide incorrect statements or facts. This symptom of cognitive impairment is prevalent within the AD population. Specifically, the elements affected are processes regarding time and location, meaning patients often do not know where they are or they cannot recall the time (Hirono et al., 1998; El Haj and Kapogiannis, 2016). This specificity is already tested for in most cognitive tests (see table _) and is done so through questioning the individual on where they are and what the time is (see table _). Although these phenomena are universally tested for the underlying clinical correlation has not yet been established. There have been a lot of investigations into this link, however a consensus has not yet been determined. For example, the impairments of time perception have been linked to many areas of the brain including the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum and hippocampus. There are also many models to describe the functions of time perception which are said to be impaired in this symptom, one of these is the internal clock model (Fontes et al., 2016).  

Aside from these debated mechanisms there are strong links made between disorientation and memory. Episodic memory, the processing of past personal information (Fontes et al., 2016), loss has been linked to the loss of the ability to retrieve information about time. This decline of memory and abnormal disorientation has been linked to the hippocampus. Although memory impairment can indicate severe neurodegeneration, disorientation has been observed early in AD (El Haj and Kapogiannis, 2016). This suggest that disorientation could be a could biomarker for early detection as it may precede severe impairment to memory. The ability to observe disorientation without severe memory loss could be due to an area of the brain called the posterior cingulate gyrus. In a study by Hirono in 1998 it was found that there was hypometabolism of glucose in this region irrespective of memory impairment (Hirono et al., 1998). It has been found that this reduction of glucose metabolism occurs during the preclinical stages of AD (Mosconi, Pupi and De Leon, 2008) supporting the use of disorientation in early detection.  

Although it is stated that this occurs despite memory impairment the link between memory and disorientation is still important to note. This link is also supported by the structure of the posterior cingulate cortex, specifically its connections with other areas of the brain. The posterior cingulate cortex has many connections with the medial temporal memory system (Hirono et al., 1998). This system includes the hippocampus, which not only plays a role in declarative memory, comprising of episodic and semantic memory (Lingford-Hughes and Kalk, 2012), but it has also been specifically linked to time perception (El Haj and Kapogiannis, 2016). Although in the early stages impairments of the hippocampus might not be enough to explain the disorientation it could be due to the connections with the posterior cingulate cortex. It has been observed that in the early stage of AD that there is a decline in synaptic numbers compared to cognitively normal individuals. This was also found in patients with MCI; however, the difference was not as severe as in AD patients. These findings were also supported by MMSE scores showing that tis impairment can be seen detected by early cognitive test (Scheff et al., 2015). As the posterior cingulate cortex relates to the hippocampus the decrease in the synaptic connections may explain the disorientation symptom recorded by the cognitive tests.  

Overall, the evidence for the existence of disorientation and its potential clinical pathophysiology indicates its occurrence early in the onset of AD. This means that disorientation could be a positive marker for the potential onset of Alzheimer’s disease in the future.",AD,Cognition
Visuospatial impairment,"Visuospatial skills are one of the key abilities impaired by the pathology of dementia. These skills are defined by an individual’s capacity to comprehend visual and spatial relationships between distinct points or objects (NeuRA, 2019). The degeneration seen in dementia patients makes it hard to identify these relationships and instead they display deficits in visuospatial skills. This capability is routinely tested for in standard dementia tests (see table _). Some of the examples of the specific visuospatial tests include clock drawing and the copying of a figure, however there are many varieties of test used to assess this function (see table _). It has been found that this type of impairment is prevalent in both AD and DLB (Prvulovic et al., 2002; Beretta et al., 2019). However, the pathophysiology of this occurrence is said to differ between the dementia subtypes (Beretta et al., 2019). As well as this it has been suggested that this difference in pathophysiology also has a different impact on the cognitive state of the individual (Hamilton et al., 2008).  
 
Visuospatial difficulties in AD patients has been linked to problems with the superior parietal cortex. The superior parietal cortex has been said to have an important role in the performance of visuospatial functions (Corbetta et al., 1993; Wang et al., 2014), some papers even state that it is essential to these abilities (Prvulovic et al., 2002). The involvement of the superior parietal cortex in this function is supported by the evidence of impairment upon stimulation by visuospatial activities. For example, it has been found that this area of the brain is less active in AD patients compared to controls. This is said to be due to damage caused by AD pathology, presenting through a reduction in glucose metabolism, reduced blood flow and increased atrophy of gray and white matter in this region (Prvulovic et al., 2002). This damage coupled with its suggested role in visuospatial functioning supports the link to its affect in visuospatial tasks in AD patients.  
 
Problems performing visuospatial tasks is also a characteristic feature of DLB. This type of dementia has a different pathology to AD and so we see different areas of the brain affected. Some of these areas are thought to play a role in visuospatial performance. It has been recently shown that more severe visuospatial impairment is correlated with occipital hypometabolism in the lateral occipital cortex, calcarine cortex, fusiform and lingual gyri (Beretta et al., 2019). These areas of the brain have different specific functions however they are all related to elements that make up the definition of visuospatial function. For example, the lateral occipital cortex is important in object recognition (Grill-Spector, Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2001) and the calcarine cortex is the primary visual cortex responsible for processing visual stimuli (Meadows, 2011). The damage to these areas seen through occipital hypometabolism can be used for early detection as this affect has been observed to occur in prodromal DLB (Kemp et al., 2017). As this affect is correlated with damage that is linked to deficits in visuospatial abilities it is possible to use cognitive testing to identify these deficits and predict the risk of developing DLB before severe damage to memory occurs.  
 
Visuospatial issues can also be detected in MCI patients and it has been found that those that have non-amnestic MCI are more likely to develop DLB and patients with amnestic MCI are more likely to be diagnosed with probable AD in the future (Ferman et al., 2013). This increases the support for visuospatial testing in early prediction of dementia. ","AD, DLB",Cognition
Executive function,"Executive functions are the result of processes within the brain which are responsible for inhibitory control, planning, cognitive flexibility and staying focused (Diamond, 2013; Kuzmickienė and Kaubrys, 2016). Like many of the other areas of cognition, executive function is already integrated into integrated dementia (see table _). The ability to perform executive functions is seen to be impaired in several dementia subtypes. These subtypes are AD, VaD, DLB and FTD- bvFTD and non-fluent PPA (nfvPPA) (Johns et al., 2009; McGuinness et al., 2010; Kuzmickienė and Kaubrys, 2016; Rabinovici, 2017).  

AD pathology has been linked to cause problems with executive function as one of the first signs in the course of disease progression. A study by Harrington in 2013 aimed to be able to predict preclinical AD and locate early pathology in the brain. From this they observed a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid beta amyloid42 alongside decreased performance of executive tasks. They supported with link by finding deposits of extracellular amyloid within the basal isocortex. Not only did they find this link, but they also found that the deposits of amyloid first occurred in this region of the brain (Harrington et al., 2013). This suggests that detecting impairment in executive function could mean identifying the pathology at the very early stages or that will lead to AD in the future.  

FTD also exhibits problems when testing with tasks of executive function. In particular, the FTD subtypes affected in this way are bvFTD and non-fluent PPA (Rabinovici, 2017). FTD is based on the theory that there is a decrease in fractional anisotropy in tracts that interconnect gray matter regions which undergo atrophy. This means that all the varieties of FTD types is due to which of the tracts is involved (Masdeu and Pascual, 2016). bvFTD has been closely correlated with the cingulum tract, particularly the anterior cingulum (Tartaglia et al., 2012). It has been noted that there is evidence for the involvement of this tract in executive functioning, specifically that the anterior cingulum characteristics might correlate with executive function (Bubb, Metzler-Baddeley and Aggleton, 2018). In addition to this is has been seen that, accounting for gray matter atrophy, a reduction in integrity of these specific white matter tracts may contribute to the decline in cognition, including executive function, seen in bvFTD patients (Masdeu and Pascual, 2016).  

As well as bvFTD, the other FTD subtypes presenting these difficulties is nfvPPA. Although this has been suggested it is still debated, with some studies not showing any difference between them and controls (Wicklund, Johnson and Weintraub, 2004; Harciarek and Cosentino, 2013). However, there is still evidence for its prevalence, when tested with the trail making test part B, at an even higher magnitude than shown in bvFTD patients (Harciarek and Cosentino, 2013).  

Another dementia subtype that experiences executive dysfunction is DLB (Kemp et al., 2017). In patients with DLB deficits in executive function are strongly related to the frontal region of the brain (Metzler-Baddeley, 2007; Firbank et al., 2016). Within the frontal region it is said to be specifically linked to impairment of the prefrontal cortex (Leh, Petrides and Strafella, 2010). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the ventrolateral and the orbital prefrontal cortex have been said to be associated with the performance of executive functions, so impairment of this area would explain the problems observed (Metzler-Baddeley, 2007; Leh, Petrides and Strafella, 2010). In addition to this a recent study has made a link between urinary dysfunction and executive dysfunction through shared underlying pathology. They suggest that both executive functions early in the disease and urinary dysfunction are both due to issues with the prefrontal cortex, specifically its pathway with the basal ganglia (Haruta et al., 2019). Executive function has been linked to the activation of the basal ganglia (Leh, Petrides and Strafella, 2010). The observation of this shared underlying pathology and its involvement in DLB supports the use of executive function coupled with urinary dysfunction as a good indicator or predictor of early DLB (Haruta et al., 2019). Finally, executive function has also been used to differentiate between FTD and DLB by test performance, specifically using the Stroop test (Johns et al., 2009). This allows for the specific dementia subtype to be predicted.  

Lastly, VaD has also been seen to have deficits in executive functioning (McGuinness et al., 2010; Sudo et al., 2017). These appear early in the disease and have been linked to impairment of cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control (Sudo et al., 2017). Cognitive flexibility has been linked to the performance of the basal ganglia, anterior cingulate cortex, and the prefrontal cortex (Leber, Turk-Browne and Chun, 2008). There have been studies into the role of the prefrontal cortex in flexibility, specifically switching tasks, which have found involvement of the anterior prefrontal cortex and the mid-prefrontal regions (Kim et al., 2011). There have also been findings into the association of the basal ganglia and cognitive flexibility, indicating that damage to this area is involved in flexibility impairment. The basal ganglia have also been seen to be affected in VaD, specifically subcortical VaD, by the presence of multiple microinfarcts in this area (Kalaria and Erkinjuntti, 2006). This damage could cause the deficits in executive function.","AD, FTD, bvFTD, nfvPPA, VaD, DLB",Cognition
Attention,"Attention is the ability to concentrate and switch between stimuli without disorientation or uncontrolled loss of interest. It is one of the areas already assessed during dementia testing (see table _). It has been noted to be impaired in DLB and AD (Ballard et al., 2001). 

DLB patients are diagnosed due to several factors, some symptomatic and others pathological. One pathological factor is the excess of glutamate. The build-up of glutamate is a characteristic feature of DLB and leads to neurodegeneration over time (Ho et al., 2019). One of the medications used to stop the effects of excess glutamate is called memantine (NHS, 2016). Memantine has been used on DLB patients from which their attention impairment has improved (Wesnes et al., 2015). This suggests that attention dysfunction occurs because of excess glutamate. As too much glutamate can lead to neurodegeneration being able to identify signs of its prevalence early is important, which may be possible through tests of attention.  

AD patients have also been seen to have difficulties in tasks requiring attention, specifically spatial attention, early in the course of the disease (Perry and Hodges, 1999; Rizzo et al., 2000; Saunders and Summers, 2011). MCI has been said to be the preceding stage before development of AD and so features present during MCI may be good predictors for development of AD. For example, a study by Saunders in 2011 found that decline in sustained attention in amnestic MCI and non-amnestic MCI may be an early predictor for dementia development. They also distinguished an early indicator for amnestic MCI, the decline in divided attention abilities (Saunders and Summers, 2011). Deficits in spatial attention have also been linked to AD. This impairment is hypothesised to occur due to damage of the Posner model, a network within the brain controlled by three distinct areas, the posterior parietal lobe, superior colliculus and the thalamus (Posner and Petersen, 1990; Perry and Hodges, 1999). This model could explain the impairment seen, as damage to these three areas are found in AD patients. For example, senile plaques have been observed in the superior colliculus of people suffering from AD (Iseki et al., 1989). These deficits in attention can be seen through cognitive testing and so may be promising in early detection of AD. ","DLB, AD",Cognition
Pace,"A reduced pace and increased gait variability have been linked to impairment of attention and executive functioning while temporal gait impairment is linked with memory impairment (Ries et al., 2009).

A structured review by McArdle R et al., 2017 looks at gait impairment in subtypes of dementia with the following observations for AD patients. AD patients tend to have reduced pace when compared to controls which the degree increasing with severity of disease.

For gait impairment in Lewy body dementia (LBD) patients, pace is generally found to be reduced in subjects with LBD in comparison to controls.

For gait impairments in VaD (Tanaka et al., 1995), characteristics of pace are found to be reduced in VaD when compared to controls. Characteristics of postural control were not found to be reduced in VaD. ","AD, DLB",Gait
Rhythm,"Characteristics of rhythm (step, swing, and stance time) were also found to be impaired in AD when compared to controls. (McArdle R et al., 2017) 
In LBD, characteristics of rhythm were found to be impaired compared to controls. (Fritz et al., 2016).","AD, DLB",Gait
Asymmetry,"Characteristics of asymmetry (step time, swing and stance asymmetry) found no significant difference between AD, MCI and controls.",AD,Gait
Postural control,"Characteristics of postural control were not found to be different between controls and LBD (Fritz et al., 2016) or between controls VaD (Tanaka et al., 1995). Characteristics of postural control found no significant differences between AD and controls. (McArdle R et al., 2017) ",,Gait
gait variability,"In older persons with MCI (mild cognitive impairment), high temporal gait variability is associated with a smaller volume of the primary motor cortex (Dric Annweiler et al., 2016) however not with smaller hippocampal volume (Beauchet et al., 2015). Dual-task gait tests displaying high temporal gait variability has been associated with primary motor cortex neuronal integrity loss as well. In older persons with MMI (mild memory impairment), high spatial gait variability is associated with hippocampal neuronal integrity loss (Zimmerman et al., 2009) 

Increased gait variability has also been linked to impairment of attention and executive functioning (Ries et al., 2009). Executive function which is another biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases has a correlation with gait variability with the extent of executive dysfunction is correlated with degree of variability of stride time (Hausdorff et al., 2005). It should be noted however that while gait variability may be indicative of changes due to ageing and/or cognitive impairment, the associated changes in the brain are yet unclear (Tian et al., 2017) 

Characteristics of gait variability in AD (step velocity, step length, and step width variability) shows inconsistent results between studies with almost equal numbers finding increase while an equal number not reporting an increase. (McArdle R et al., 2017). Characteristics of rhythm were found to be impaired compared to controls. Characteristics of gait variability found no group differences between LBD and PD (Fritz et al., 2016). For gait impairments in VaD, characteristics of pace are found to be reduced in VaD when compared to controls. ",VD,Gait
Hearing loss,"Hearing loss can be defined in multiple ways, but it is ultimately the impaired function of the auditory pathways. The pathways involved impact the different types of hearing loss experienced. Hearing loss can be separated into two separate categories, central hearing loss and peripheral hearing loss (Harvard Health Publications, 2019). Both types of loss have been mentioned in association with dementia, specifically how they can affect the risk of dementia development.  

Central hearing loss occurs due to the impairment of the central auditory pathways (CAP). A main part of the CAP is the medial geniculate body (MGB) (Gray, 1997). The MGB is a thalamic relay neuron which has the key responsibility of passing information on to areas within the cerebral cortex which are responsible for understanding the signals (Amunts et al., 2013). Damage to this area will cause problems in the comprehensions of speech, especially in loud environments such as a busy café or train station. People experiencing this problem are then said to have a central auditory speech processing disorder (Gates et al., 2002). This relates strongly to AD as it has been noted that senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have been found within the medial geniculate body of people suffering with AD (Sinha et al., 1993). This damage would explain the impairment of the CAP. There have been several studies which have investigated the ability of CAP in AD patients. For example, a study in 2011 by Idrizbegovic investigated the performance of AD patients, compared to controls, on a test specified for testing CAP. This study found that the performance of AD patients was significantly poorer than that of the controls. They also found that the test could differentiate between people with MCI and cognitively normal people. This is important for determining dementia risk as within the following 3 years 20% of MCI patients developed dementia, and 70% of these were diagnosed with AD (Idrizbegovic et al., 2011). This means that it is possible to detect the cognitive impairment, which could deteriorate into dementia, as early as in mild cognitive impairment.  

Peripheral hearing loss has also been linked to AD. It has been said that this type of hearing loss could cause the decline of cognition to accelerate leading to diagnosis of dementia (Hardy et al., 2016). Peripheral hearing loss occurs due to problems with the structures that make up the ear. These problems can be subcategorised into conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (Harvard Health Publications, 2019). These types are centred around the inability for the ear to transmit signals to the brain effectively. This means that the brain isn’t yet involved in the deterioration of hearing and so cannot be explained by any significant cognitive decline. This adds to the association that the impairment of hearing can lead to the decrease in cognitive health as it occurs prior to the symptoms of cognitive worsening. When investigating peripheral hearing loss, the most common technique is pure tone audiometry (Zheng et al., 2017) which is the gold standard technique for measuring overall hearing loss.  

Overall, the use of hearing loss as a marker for dementia, particularly AD, is promising. There are several studies which support the ability for hearing loss to act as a predictor for dementia. These are especially good as the time between hearing loss detection and onset of dementia is many years in the future, meaning it is possible in use for early detection (Idrizbegovic et al., 2011; Gurgel et al., 2014; Deal et al., 2017).",AD,Hearing
Sound aversion,"Sound aversion is the adverse response to sounds and noises, presenting through strong abnormal behaviours. Sound aversion has been seen to occur in patient’s frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Specifically, within FTD the subtypes most likely to exhibit this behaviour are bvFTD and semantic dementia (SD). FTD diseases are said to experience this symptom due to the loss of gray matter in the nucleus accumbens (Fletcher et al., 2015). The nucleus accumbens is part of the reward system within the brain, paired with dopamine release (McCutcheon et al., 2012). This function has been linked to the core of the nucleus accumbens, however there is another section of this structure which has been defined as having a response function to non-rewarding stimuli, this area is called the shell of the nucleus accumbens (Ambroggi et al., 2011). It has been found that projections within the shell respond to adverse stimuli by a suppression of the release of dopamine (McCutcheon et al., 2012). From this it is possible to infer that the phenomena of sound aversion in FTD patients is due to the failure of the mechanisms within the core, resulting in the pathways within the shell being activated. This opposite stimulation could result in the abnormal behaviours seen. Another similar behaviour observed within FTD patients is aversion to music. This differs compared to normal sound aversion as it affects areas of the brain other than the nucleus accumbens. Music aversion has been associated with loss of gray matter in the right anterior temporal cortex, entorhinal cortex hippocampus, amygdala and the bilateral mid and posterior insula (Fletcher et al., 2015). The insula has a strong link to central auditory processing at it receives neuron projections from the primary auditory, auditory association, and post auditory cortices. Deficits within the insula have been seen to impact central auditory processes and these can manifest through problems in sound detection, non-verbal stimuli and phonologic processing (Uddin et al., 2017).  

In comparison to other dementia types AD also exhibits sound aversions (Fletcher et al., 2015; Hardy et al., 2016), however the pathophysiology is different. Upon inspection of AD patients, it has been found that there is significant gray matter loss in the anterior cingulate cortex (Fletcher et al., 2015). Sound aversion, in AD, is one of the main behaviours observed alongside hearing loss. Therefore, coupling hearing loss and sound aversion into a single profile would allow people at risk or in the early stages of AD be identified.  ","FTD-SD, bvFTD, AD",Hearing
Musicophilia,"Musicophilia is the abnormal obsession with listening to music. This phenomenon has been noted in patients with FTD, specifically SD (Fletcher et al., 2015). This behaviour although accepted is not widely understood. There have been many studies which have tried to investigate the cause of this abnormality, specifically its link to dementia. However, although evidence has been found for the involvement of parts of the brain the pathophysiology is yet to be determined. Despite this the evidence strongly points towards the structure and function of the mesial temporal lobe as main factor (Fletcher, Clark and Warren, 2014).  

The mesial temporal lobe is an area of the brain made up of the hippocampus, amygdala and parahippocampal region (Bernasconi et al., 2003). It has been noted that the hippocampus undergoes changes when musicophilia occurs. These differences include the significant increase in gray matter volume in the left posterior hippocampus (Fletcher et al., 2013) and the atrophy of the anterior hippocampus (Laakso et al., 2000). This link with the hippocampus could also be related to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Musicophilia has previously been associated with OCD (Zungu-Dirwayi et al., 1999). It has been found in patients that experience high level OCD symptoms that there is a significantly lower hippocampal volume (Reess et al., 2018). The lower hippocampal volume of OCD can be associated with the hippocampal atrophy seen in FTD despite the links to increased gray matter in the posterior hippocampus. Gray matter volume in the posterior has been seen to remain the same instead of increase (Fletcher et al., 2013) meaning the association could be possible. This means that the OCD symptoms relating to the changes in the hippocampal volume could be expressed through the craving for music observed in FTD patients.  

In addition to the hippocampus the amygdala could also be an important area in understanding musicophilia. The amygdala, which is a bilateral mesial temporal lobe structure, has been linked with the strong emotional responses linked to certain stimuli such as music (Rohrer, Smith and Warren, 2006). In patients with SD observations have been made of atrophy of the bilateral temporal lobe (Baird, 2019). This means that the damage to the lobe in SD could result in the abnormal obsession with listening to music. Musicophilia is an important behaviour in the early detection of SD as not only is it most commonly found in this type of disease, but it is also the most prevalent symptom in relation to hearing within this dementia subtype (Fletcher et al., 2013, 2015).",FTD-SD,Hearing
Auditory hallucinations,"The term auditory hallucinations cover a wide range of auditory phenomena experienced by an individual. Auditory hallucinations are common in some dementia subtypes, specifically DLB and FTD-SD (Hardy et al., 2016) and so could act as good biomarkers for early detection. A positive aspect of using auditory hallucinations is that they differ between the types of dementia allowing specific inferences to be made on the risk of developing which subtype.  

A common auditory hallucination is called tinnitus. Tinnitus has been specified to occur in patients suffering from FTD-SD (Mahoney et al., 2011; Hardy et al., 2016). It is defined as the presence of abnormal auditory perception (manifesting as ringing within the ears (Eggermont and Roberts, 2004)) in the absence of an external source (Mahoney et al., 2011). There have been several studies proposing the possible pathophysiology for tinnitus and it is still currently being debated. For example, Eggermont in a 2011 paper suggested that the phenomena were due to the coupled effects of hyperactive peripheral neurons and underactive modulating or inhibitory central neurons. They stated that this affect would negatively impact the central circuitry in the brain resulting in the unique abnormality (Eggermont and Roberts, 2004; Mahoney et al., 2011). In addition to the study there have been others which have specified specific areas of the brain. These areas of the brain include the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula (Mahoney et al., 2011; Ryan and Bauer, 2016; Schultz, Sepehry and Greer, 2018). Looking specifically into SD patients the observation of an atrophic effect on the orbitofrontal cortex has been found in relation to tinnitus (Mahoney et al., 2011). This area of the brain receives auditory projections from the other areas of the brain (Rolls, 2004) supporting the idea that it could be involved in the pathophysiology of tinnitus. Not only is tinnitus a good marker for being specific to SD but it has also been associated with a decrease in the cognitive performance (Clarke et al., 2018; Schultz, Sepehry and Greer, 2018). For example, a 2004 study conducted by Hallam found that people with tinnitus were less efficient at performing cognitive tasks than controls (Hallam, Mckenna and Shurlock, 2004). Another study also concluded that cognition was impacted by tinnitus due to its effects on cognitive capacity needed to complete specific tasks (Rossiter, Stevens and Walker, 2006). These links show that there is potential for tinnitus to be used as an early detector for SD or even a factor for increased risk for SD development.  

Auditory hallucinations are also observed in people suffering from Dementia with Lewy Bodies. However, instead of tinnitus patients are said to report hearing voices and muffled sounds. It has also been said that some experience musical hallucinations (Donaghy, O’Brien and Thomas, 2015; Hardy et al., 2016; Donaghy et al., 2018; Tsunoda et al., 2018). The hearing of voices is widely connected with schizophrenia; however, this could be a misdiagnosis. The presence of these auditory hallucinations could be predictive of DLB. This link was recently made in a 2018 case study by Hindi when monitoring the health records of a man over the space of just over a year. The records for this study begin at the admittance of the man into hospital due to claims of him hearing voices. The conclusion to this was that he had schizophrenia. However, over the course of a year the man’s health deteriorated until he presented with symptoms indicative of DLB (Hindi and Lawrence, 2018). This could mean that DLB and schizophrenia share a similar pathophysiology for this hallucination. This could potentially mean that people diagnosed with schizophrenia based on this symptom are also at risk of developing DLB in the future. It has been observed in patients with schizophrenia that there is an activation of an area of the brain called the Heschl gyrus when auditory hallucinations occur (Dierks et al., 1999). It could be that this area is also activated in patients with DLB, when this symptom occurs, explaining the link. ","DLB, FTD-SD",Hearing
Visual acuity,"Visual Acuity (VA), or the sharpness or clarity of vision, is expected to decline with age (). There is mixed evidence for the enhanced deterioration of VA in AD patients compared to controls (Rizzo, Anderson and Nawrot, 2000; Froiman and Elias, 2013; Polo et al., 2017). Stover & Brown (2012) found a significant deterioration of VA using the APPswe/PS1dE9 murine model of AD, an effect which was not replicated using the C57BL/6J model (Buscher et al., 2017). Loss of VA has been found to correlate with decreased macular pigment (Nolan et al., 2014), which in turn is linked to cognitive function (Feeney et al., 2013). Differences in VA have not been found in DLB (Armstrong, 2012) and are not reported for any other dementia type.",AD,Ocular function
Colour vision,"There is some evidence that AD patients may experience defects in colour vision (Wood et al., 1997; Polo et al., 2017) independent of disease progression (Pache et al., 2003). Polo et al. (2017) found impairment in colour vision, assessed via the Farnsworth and L'Anthony D-15 tests, to be correlated to macular volume.",AD,Ocular function
Depth perception,"Alterations in stereoacuity, or ability to perceive depth have also been noted in AD, particularly in the Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) variant (Kiyosa et al., 1989; Meadows, 1996; Thiyagesh et al., 2009; Gillebert et al., 2015) and VD (Mittenberg, Choi and Apple, 2000). Problems with depth perception has also been identified in DLB, with individuals reporting visual hallucinations being most severely affected (Mori et al., 2000). Decline in depth perception ability is likely due to cortical degeneration (Mittenberg, Choi and Apple, 2000; Gillebert et al., 2015; Bridge, 2016). PD patients experiencing abnormal stereopsis perform worse on colour discrimination and motor function tasks, independent of cognitive impairment (Sun et al., 2014) indicating that visual impairment in this context may not be linked to PD related dementia.","AD, VD, DLB",Ocular function
Motion perception,"Individuals with AD, DLB and PDD also present with defects in motion processing, with AD patients showing the greatest impairment (Landy et al., 2015).","AD, DLB, PDD",Ocular function
Pupillary function,"Aside from these visual processing differences, there is much interest in pupillary function and eye movement as these can be objectively and non-invasively measured using eye tracking technologies. This allows for a simple way to analyse parasympathetic function, of relevance to AD given that Acetylcholine (Ach) is the major neurotransmitter responsible for these processes, with cholinergic defects well accepted as a hallmark of this disease (Wang et al., 2016; Van Stavern et al., 2019). There is mixed evidence to support hypersensitivity to cholinergic antagonists as observed via pupil dilation as a useful diagnostic tool for AD (Scinto et al., 1994; Caputo, Casartelli and Perrone, 1998; Takagi et al., 1999). A review of Pupillary Light Response (PLR) found maximum velocity of constriction (MCV) and maximum constriction acceleration (MCA) to be the most accurate measures for identifying AD (Chougule et al., 2019), however, they note that this difference may not be so clear in MCI or preclinical AD (Bittner et al., 2014; Van Stavern et al., 2019).  Although PLR may be a good indicator of parasympathetic function (Wang et al., 2016) its use as a diagnostic tool for AD is still debated (Chougule et al., 2019).",AD,Ocular function
Contrast sensitivity,"It is reported that dementia patients with AD (Lakshminarayanan et al., 1996; Crow et al., 2003; Neargarder et al., 2003; Risacher et al., 2013; Tzekov and Mullan, 2014; Polo et al., 2017; Oishi et al., 2018), DLB (Oishi et al., 2018), and VD (Lakshminarayanan et al., 1996) have an increased contrast sensitivity threshold compared to controls but measuring this may be confounded by the visual acuity of and individual (Neargarder et al., 2003). There is also some evidence that decreased contrast sensitivity could be detected at the stage of MCI using a Frequency doubling technology (FDT) method (Risacher et al., 2013). Decreased contrast sensitivity likely contributes to many of the problems dementia patients experience with day to day functioning, falls and visual hallucinations (Cormack, Tovee and Ballard, 2000).","AD, DLB, VD",Ocular function
Eye movement,"Changes in the ability of the eye to perform rapid short movements and smooth movement, and its ability to track moving objects are seen in dementia and can also be measured non-invasively. There is also hope that differences in ocular movement may provide signs to distinguish dementia type or early onset. Cognitive ability and saccade latency have been found to correlate in AD patients with amnesiac MCI also showing saccade latency in specific conditions (Yang et al., 2013). Smooth saccadic movement appears to be a problem in AD (Fletcher and Sharpe, 1986; Zaccara et al., 1992; Boxer et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2014). AD can be differentiated from FTD by increased horizontal saccade latency although both groups show deficits in ocular movement (Boxer et al., 2012). Saccade latency has also been reported in DLB (Brett, Henson and Staunton, 2002). Rösler et al. (2005) reported abnormal visual search patterns in subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) which they suggest results from cognitive impairment slowing their progress rather any problem with ocular movement. 

There are relatively few studies which directly compare dementia subtypes and their eye movement impairment. Mosimann et al. (2005) found AD patients impaired in performing complex saccades and PD patients in reflexive saccades, however, PDD and DLB showed similar impairment in reflexive and complex saccades. This allowed them to distinguish DLB from AD and PDD from PD (Mosimann et al., 2005). Comparison of FTD, svFTD, PNFA, Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), and AD found that, except for svFTD, all patients showed abnormal saccades (Garbutt et al., 2008). PSP patients showed greatest impairment with abnormal saccade velocity, gain, and anti-saccade production with CBS and AD patients also showing alterations in saccade gain and reduced performance on an anti-saccade task. Interestingly FTD and PNFA also showed reduced performance on the anti-saccade task but could correct this comparably to controls giving several distinct profiles which could be investigated further to produce diagnostic profiles (Garbutt et al., 2008).  

Although impairment of visual attention is problematic when assessing aspects of ocular function discussed above, it can indicate dementia. AD sufferers appear more susceptible to distractors, or unable to ignore non-essential information (Sala et al., 1992; Baddeley et al., 2001; Levinoff et al., 2004; Landy et al., 2015) which may point to a defect in inhibitory selective attention (Levinoff et al., 2004). However, this is not a consistent finding (Fernandez-Duque and Black, 2008). Impairments have also been found in disengaging and switching attention in AD patients (Parasuraman et al., 1992; Tales et al., 2002).

PSWC,"EEG is already an established tool for the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), with the incidence of PSWC triphasic morphology allowing for other pathologies to be ruled out when seeking a diagnosis (Wieser, Schindler and Zumsteg, 2006). Patients with DLB and AD can also present with similar PSWC patterns (Tschampa et al., 2001).","CJD, DLB",Neuronal activity
GTE,"Grand Total EEG (EEG) combines scoring on several different factors: rhythmic background activity, diffuse slow-wave activity, reactivity, paroxysmal activity (frontal intermittent rhythmic activity (FIRDA)), focal abnormalities, and sharp-wave activity (Roks et al., 2008; Lee, Brekelmans and Roks, 2015). GTE scoring can indicate the extent of abnormalities detected in the whole of the EEG which is relevant for comparison of diseases such as AD and DLB both of which exhibit cholinergic defects which are considered more pronounced in DLB (Briel et al., 1999; Roks et al., 2008; Lee, Brekelmans and Roks, 2015). Atypical Parkinsonian disorders, including Corticobasal degeneration, can also be distinguished using GTE, with non-demented PD patients displaying normal EEG profiles (Lasmezas et al., 2019).","AD, DLB, CBD",Neuronal activity
Frequency Bands,"Activity detected by EEG is divided into bands by frequency ranges (theta, 4-8Hz, alpha 8-14Hz, beta 14-30Hz, gamma, over 30Hz) (Al-Qazzaz et al., 2014; Abo-Zahhad, Ahmed and Abbas, 2015). Alpha waves occur in healthy adults at rest with eyes closed. It is rhythmic but can me disrupted by opening the eyes or other external stimuli. Beta waves are higher frequency, but lower amplitude than alpha waves, they increase during CNS stimulation or heightened attention replacing alpha waves in cognitive impairment. Theta waves, when present across the scalp, are associated with periods of non-attention, drowsiness and cognitive impairment, but are associated with glucose metabolism and attention when present at the frontal mid-line. Delta waves occur during sleep. Gamma waves are associated with sensory processing (when present in the somatosensory cortex) and short-term memory. When associated with Theta bands they are also considered indicative of cognitive impairment (Al-Qazzaz et al., 2014). The EEG profile can be assessed within the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) which includes alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma, and the dominant frequency (DF) or frequency with the highest power in the EEG spectrum (Peraza et al., 2018). In this way EEG can produce a profile of brain waves which may indicate dementia type or severity.  

Several distinctive EEG parameters have been identified to distinguish AD from VD. Neto et al., (2015) found that both VD and AD had an increased beta and delta wave power compared to controls as well as a slowed alpha rhythm. AD was found to have a lower occipital and temporal alpha power whereas VD saw an increased alpha power compared to both AD and controls. They propose that the differences in alpha distribution could be used as a biomarker for distinguishing the diseases (Neto et al., 2015). Wu, Chen, & Zhou, (2014) found that VD had generally high theta power compared to AD patients which showed higher posterior theta/delta power. LORETA (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography) analysis indicated lower delta values and higher posterior alpha 2 and beta 1 values in VD versus AD patients (Wu, Chen and Zhou, 2014). The Correlation Dimension of Reconstructed Attractor (D2) which is a measure of variability in functioning has also been found to be more uneven in VD than in AD (Jeong et al., 2001). ","MCI, AD, VD",Neuronal activity
Dominant Frequency,"The dominant frequency (DF) is the frequency with the highest power in the EEG spectrum, usually between 4 and 15Hz, typically the DF is found in the alpha band, however, loss of alpha waves as the DF and DF slowing are indicative of DLB, distinguishing it from AD (Briel et al., 1999; Peraza et al., 2018). A recent study found that quantitative EEG (QEEG) could distinguish AD from DLB with an accuracy of 94%, 92% sensitivity and 83% specificity (Stylianou et al., 2018). Here they analysed the dominant frequency (DF), and its variability (DFV). AD patients displayed greater DFV than DLB patients, but DFV only correlated with cognitive function tests in DLB patients (Stylianou et al., 2018). PDD is very hard to distinguish from Lewy Body Dementia as described by Bonanni et al., (2008). In their first measurements they could identify groups of PDD patients which either had fluctuating DLB-like cognition, with variable DF and stable alpha activity, or AD-like non-fluctuating cognition, these groups disappeared in the follow up with 74.3% of PDD patients presenting with a DLB-like EEG signature (Bonanni et al., 2008).","AD, DLB, PDD",Neuronal activity
Connectivity,"Network connectivity can also be measured using EEG defined by the Phase Lag Index (PLI), with a decrease in alpha band connectivity seen in AD and DLB compared to healthy controls which may reflect defects in the cholinergic system (van Dellen et al., 2015; Peraza et al., 2018). There is also some mixed evidence that PLI values may differ between AD and DLB (van Dellen et al., 2015; Peraza et al., 2018). The duration of Microstates also varies between AD and DLB and may be predictive of DLB severity (Schumacher et al., 2019). Microstates are topologically stable, patterned sections of the EEG signature which are thought to indicate the basic initialisation of neurological processes. However, the slowing of microstates seen in DLB cannot be explained by the slowing of the dominant frequency (Schumacher et al., 2019). These findings indicate the beginnings of a framework which can be used to predict the type and severity of DLB, however more work is needed to understand their relationships. It is also proposed that monitoring differences in REM sleep with EEG may be able to distinguish AD from DLB before symptoms present themselves (Bonanni et al., 2008). Distinguishing patients with DLB from patients with a mixed DLB AD pathology are difficult from an EEG scan, although it is still possible to separate incidences of mixed pathology from pure AD (van der Zande et al., 2018). 

Several differences have been identified between the EEG signatures of bvFTD and AD patients, mostly related to connectivity characteristics, which have diagnostic potential. FTD tends to maintain posterior alpha band connectivity compared to AD (Yu et al., 2016) which has lower functional alpha and beta signals (De Haan et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2016). AD maintains posterior beta band connectivity better compared to FTD. MST topology is also altered in these diseases, with AD experiencing a more global loss of efficiency but FTD patients tend to maintain this (Pijnenburg et al., 2008; De Haan et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2016), with efficiency lost at specific nodes within the brain (Yu et al., 2016). Although these differences were identified between diseases, this loss of function does not seem to appear until late in disease progression, so may be more helpful for distinguishing late stage disease type rather than acting as an early biomarker (Yu et al., 2016), furthermore detailed analysis is required to distinguish FTD from normal cognition as generalised efficiency and connectivity are maintained (Pijnenburg et al., 2008).  
Disease Specificity  

DLB has the most distinctive EEG investigated so far and is the most likely to progress to a clinically available diagnostic tool soon (Colloby et al., 2016). Furthermore, most studies use comparison of two dementia subtypes to each other. Caso et al. (2012) managed to distinguish between FTD and AD groups but these findings could not be replicated at the individual level. Although there are now several parameters which provide good discrimination between groups of dementias EEG’s use for the detection of very early biomarkers is still limited.","DLB, AD, FTD",Neuronal activity
Depression,"Depression is a vast disorder with a wide range of symptoms. It is comprised of mental emotions and physical symptoms. It is persistent over time and can even cause suicidal thoughts when most severe (NHS, 2016). There is much speculation surrounding the role of depression in dementia. A large majority of people agree of its prevalence within the disease, but its effects are debated. Some people believe depression to increase impairment which leads to dementia. For example, it has been noted that 10-20% of MCI patients will go on to develop dementia, especially if they are also diagnosed with depression (Gutzmann and Qazi, 2015). Additionally, another report has stated that depression was linked to a 2-to-5 times increase in the risk of developing dementia (Byers and Yaffe, 2011; Gutzmann and Qazi, 2015). On the other hand, some researchers have found no association between mood, specifically depression, and future dementia development (Becker et al., 2009). Although there is not a solid agreement on depressions effect on cognition it still has the possibility to be a useful marker in early detection.  

Depression has been specifically linked to AD, VaD and DLB (Gutzmann and Qazi, 2015) with the most prevalent symptoms occurring in VaD and DLB (Ballard et al., 1996; Fritze et al., 2011). All these three subtypes are common in that they experience frontal white matter hypersensitivity (WMH) directly associated with depression (Barber et al., 1999). White matter hypersensitivity is common in VaD patients and has been observed at a significantly higher amount than in AD, particularly in the posterior paraventricular regions (Almkvist et al., 1992). Paraventricular WMH has been seen to accelerate functional decline (Dhamoon et al., 2018) which is seen in dementia. Being able to identify the progress in WMH through depression could indicate a risk for WMH in the paraventricular region, hence becoming a risk factor for dementia.  

As well as vascular dementia, AD patients also show WMH. Aside from this there have been other hypotheses for the pathology and role of depression in this disorder. In a neuropathological study, by Rapp in 2006, it was found that there was an increase in the hippocampal plaque and tangle formations in AD patients who had struggled with depression all their lives (Rapp et al., 2006). Hippocampal damage is a characteristic element of AD and so being able to predict its development is good for early detection. Another paper also stated a link between depression and dementia through the effects of glucocorticoids. It was suggested that over production of glucocorticoids was associated with the presentation of depressive symptoms and would eventually result in hippocampal atrophy (Sjöberg et al., 2019). Although this may be true another paper suggested that it was the depressive symptoms themselves, caused by the glucocorticoids, that were responsible for the hippocampal damage observed in the onset of dementia (Gutzmann and Qazi, 2015). 

Overall, this evidence suggests that depression is a good indicator for the risk of dementia onset and so would be useful in early detection.","AD, VaD, DLB",Mood
Apathy,"Apathy is defined as a decrease in motivation to the point of disinterest. It has been widely correlated with depression as they are similar, however they are two separate distinguishable moods (Levy et al., 1998). Apathy has been linked to an increased risk of dementia development in some studies. In 2018 a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate this link. From this it was found that apathy was associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of going on to develop dementia (Van Dalen et al., 2018). In terms of dementia subtype, apathy has been seen in AD, DLB, and FTD, specifically bvFTD.  

Apathy can be seen in AD over the course of the disease and even in MCI. MCI has been said to be a preclinical stage of AD and so identifying symptoms at this stage could be a good indicator for early detection. In relation to apathy the evolution from MCI to AD is debated. It has been found that MCI patients with atrophy alone or coupled with depression have a greater risk of developing AD (Ruthirakuhan et al., 2019). Another study also showed that out of patients that progressed from MCI to AD 91.7% had symptoms of atrophy, however this study was not conclusive on the exact relationship they saw between apathy and AD (Robert et al., 2006). There is much speculation about the pathological correlation between apathy and AD. Some have suggested that apathy correlates with frontotemporal hypoperfusion (Craig et al., 1996) and others have said its with right temporoparietal hypoperfusion (Ott, Noto and Fogel, 1996). A later study has also suggested strong links between apathy and the integrity of the medial frontal regions (Apostolova et al., 2007). It has been observed that hypoperfusion is prevalent during the presentation of the disease as well as in its pre-clinical stages. It is also been said to occur in cognitively healthy people at risk of developing AD due to their family history or genetic components (Austin et al., 2011). As hypoperfusion is associated with apathy the recognition of apathy in cognitively unaffected individuals could be representative of underlying genetic factors which increase the risk of someone developing dementia. It could also be used to identify the preclinical stages of the disease early on.  

Apathy has also been observed in patients with FTD, specifically bvFTD. It is said to be the most common behavioural symptom in this FTD subtype and increases with disease severity (Quaranta et al., 2012). The apathy profile of individuals with bvFTD has been seen to differ from that of AD patients, meaning it could be used to distinguish the dementia type someone is most at risk of developing. One distinguishing feature is that it is more commonly seen coupled with disinhibition in FTD compared to AD (Levy et al., 1998). The type of apathy seen also noted to differ between these dementia subtypes. It has been seen in a preliminary investigation that affective apathy was the only behaviour symptom present that could differentiate bvFTD from AD. Affective apathy has been linked with alterations of the orbitofrontal cortex specifically its relationship with the ventral striatum (Quaranta et al., 2012). These areas of the brain also control other key functions seen to be affected in dementia, and so identification of these neurological changes through apathy could help to identify bvFTD early on in disease progression.  

DLB has also been linked to symptoms of apathy. In comparison to FTD and AD, apathy has been seen to increase the rate of cognitive decline in DLB patients over a 4-year study (Breitve et al., 2018). Apathy within DLB has been associated with reduced striatonigral uptake, a phenomenon not observed in AD patients. This deficit was also seen in MCI patients with a higher risk of developing DLB (Graff-Radford et al., 2014). This suggests that apathy is a good biomarker for DLB as if identified early it suggests the person is at risk of faster cognitive decline, relating to DLB, over the next few years.","AD, DLB, FTD- specifically bvFTD",Mood
Anxiety,"Anxiety is the feeling of being abnormally uneasy or worried. It can arise due to phobias or social interaction and can be expressed in panic attacks or PTSD (National Health Service, 2018). These symptoms have been found in AD, VaD, FTD (Porter et al., 2003), and DLB of varying frequencies (Hynninen et al., 2012). Like depression there has been much debate surrounding the impact of anxiety on dementia. It has been suggested that anxiety is associated with an increase in cognitive impairment (Ferretti et al., 2001) however, other studies have found anxiety to be of no importance in the change in cognition seen in dementia patients (Breitve et al., 2016). Although this debate is still ongoing there is still potential for anxiety to be used as a risk factor for dementia. Recently there have been systematic reviews coupled with meta-analysis which have found a significant link between anxiety and reduction in cognitive health. In a paper by Gulpers in 2016 they found proposed that anxiety was a prodromal symptom for dementia as it increased the rate of cognitive impairment (Gulpers et al., 2016). In an even more recent paper by Santabábara they also found this link to be true and quantified it as a 29% increased chance of developing dementia if you suffer from anxiety symptoms. However, this paper does specify that further research is needed due to the uncertainty the extent to which anxiety causes dementia (Santabárbara et al., 2019). From this evidence we can say with some confidence that anxiety could be a good prodrome or marker for use in early detection of dementia.","AD, VaD, FTD, DLB",Mood
Irritability/Agitation,"Irritability and agitation are very similar symptoms both which are common in AD and DLB (Yoshida et al., 2015; Koenig, Arnold and Streim, 2016). There is little information about the impact of irritability or agitation of progression of dementia. Agitation has been observed in 60% of MCI patients and 76% of AD patients, in a study investigating its link to AD (Van Der Mussele et al., 2015). As MCI is hypothesised as a precursor for AD this suggests that agitation could be used as a marker for AD development as its prevalence is so high in both disorders. However, there would need to be more evidence to confidently integrate irritability or agitation into early detection.","AD, DLB",Mood
Speech patterns,"Abnormalities in features such as semantics, syntactics, lexical complexity, and features of speech such as shimmer (amplitude variation), jitter (frequency variation), number and duration of pauses have been documented in AD patients which can be detected in computer analysis of recorded speech (Meilán et al., 2014; Fraser, Meltzer and Rudzicz, 2016; Hall et al., 2019). Pauses may allow for some compensation for other linguistic deficits, Pistono et al. (2019) found that preclinical patients who took more pauses displayed better fluency. Linguistic features are also reported to worsen over time (Nicholas et al., 1996; Emery, 2000). Grammar is largely intact in AD compared to age and education matched controls (Altmann, Kempler and Andersen, 2001; Kavé and Levy, 2003; Cuetos et al., 2007). Although initially grammatical structure remains intact in AD other alterations in speech complexity and conciseness are present and accepted to deteriorate over time (Cuetos et al., 2007). Individuals with preclinical VD display more fluent speech patterns than preclinical AD patients (Jones, Laukka and Baäckman, 2006).

Individuals with AD struggle with narrative coherence when reliving events with poorer use of visual imagery, and report lower confidence in the “realness” of their memories, and feelings of reliving, and traveling back in time, as well as showing generally poorer autobiographical memory (Haj, Kapogiannis and Antoine, 2016). Despite showing several aspects of an impoverished phenomenological memory, AD patients score higher than controls when assessing the emotion and importance of events, Haj, Kapogiannis and Antoine (2016) suggest that AD patients relive events based on emotional or familiarity as their recall of auditory, spatial, visual, and general retrieval of events is impaired, distinct from Broca’s Aphasia (Knibb et al., 2009).

DLB and PDD patients can be distinguished from PD patients in their speech with decreased fluency, number and duration of pauses, poorer grammar, and slowing of speech (Ash et al., 2011, 2012). DLB/PDD individuals also have difficulty with narrative organisation, struggling to connect concepts or maintain a theme (Ash et al., 2011; Grossman et al., 2017) which can be detected prior to onset in amnesiac-MCI (Drummond et al., 2015). progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) patients present with characteristically slow and effortful speech with overall decreased grammar comprehension and agrammatism in their own speech (Grossman and Moore, 2005; Grossman, 2017; Ash et al., 2019). They also have lower syntactic comprehension, use shorter phrases, and produce more elliptical statements, and word finding errors (Knibb et al., 2009).

Differences in techniques for displaying emotion in conversation can also alter in dementia. Prosodic range, used to convey emotion and emphasis in speech is impacted in bvFTD (Nevler et al., 2017). The use of laughter in conversation may also vary between various FTD (bvFTD, svFTD, and right temporal variant FTD (rtFTD)) and AD (Pressman et al., 2017).","AD, MCI, bvFTD, PNFA, svFTD, rtFTD, DLB, PDD, VD",Language
Speech content,"As memory deteriorates the ability of dementia patients to name specific objects or recall words becomes impaired. Changes are seen in vocabulary use lexical complexity as early as the MCI stages of dementia (Oulhaj et al., 2009; Roark et al., 2011) the severity of which can be used to predict duration till dementia onset (Oulhaj et al., 2009) with different linguistic markers separating MCI, dementia, and healthy controls from each other (Hall et al., 2019). Loss of the “richness” or propositional density can be detected in MCI (Smolík et al., 2016). There is evidence of decreased verb use and comprehension in PD (Cousins and Grossman, 2017), healthy carriers of the E280A mutation, prior to an AD or MCI diagnosis, demonstrated reduced use of semantic units, and simplified verb use compared to controls, although linguistic features such as pauses or paraphasia were not yet apparent (Cuetos et al., 2007). Anomia, or difficulty with word finding is, found in, AD and DLB (Lambon Ralph et al., 2001), all forms of PPA (Tang-Wai and Graham, 2008; Grossman, 2017) (svFTD (Kempler and Goral, 2008), PNFA (Knibb et al., 2009), lvPPA (Ash et al., 2019)), and bvFTD (Hardy et al., 2016). This may be an extralinguistic; forgetting the word or failing to recall through impaired intention, or an underlying semantic defect (Kempler and Goral, 2008). Both AD and svFTD patients present with this deficit, however svFTD individuals appear additionally to struggle with semantic word comprehension does not present in AD (Kempler and Goral, 2008). In mixed vascular AD, reduced lexical and syntactic complexity can distinguish it from un-mixed AD using a machine learning approach (Rentoumi et al., 2014). Loss of the “richness” of language, or propositional density can be detected as early as MCI (Smolík et al., 2016). However, individuals with MCI may attempt to compensate for deteriorating memory by using a wider vocabulary when describing events (Aramaki et al., 2016). 

Dementia may also impact the individuals’ ability to perform correct present to past tense English verb transformations (Patterson et al., 2001; Cortese et al., 2006). There is some variation in these tense forming errors between svFTD and AD (Cortese et al., 2006). General impairment in verb fluency can be detected in MCI with clinical AD patients’ performance even poorer (Östberg et al., 2005; Alegret et al., 2018). Méligne et al. (2011) found that there was a switch to more generic verbs (“remove” instead of “peel” for example). Individuals with PNFA and svFTD tend to use more generic words, with svFTD individuals being influenced by familiarity, and PNFA showing more limitations in their verb usage (Fraser et al., 2014; Marcotte et al., 2014). Although Graham, Patterson and Hodges (2004) did not find substantial differences in verb use in PNFA. DLB and PDD have also been shown to have abnormal use of grammar in their speech (Ash et al., 2011, 2012).","MCI, AD, DLB, svFTD, PNFA, PDD",Language
Written language content,"Analysis of the works of authors diagnosed with AD supports the deterioration of language use in dementia. Iris Murdoch showed a deterioration in structure, syntax and lexical diversity (Garrard et al., 2005; Pakhomov et al., 2011). This reduction of complexity also appears in Agatha Christie’s later works with repetitive phrases and increased use of indefinite words were also prevalent (Lancashire and Hirst, 2009). This simplification of language has can also be detected in personal journals of the general population (Weyerman, Rose and Norton, 2017). ","AD, MCI",Language
Dysgraphia,"Dysgraphia is reported for multiple types of dementia, although it frequently occurs in AD it is not present in every case (Graham, 2000) and presents in in variable ways (Luzzatti, Laiacona and Agazzi, 2003). Although changes in language use and spelling may result from a linguistic impairment poor form of letters and difficulty producing written words is related to fine motor control (discussed section X).  Onofri et al. (2015) found a deterioration in performance on a cognitive test for AD patients after completion of a writing task, which they suggest results from cognitive fluctuation during written communication. DLB patients in comparison did not experience this change (Onofri et al., 2015). Problems with writing are also seen in Japanese, with AD patients presenting with problems writing kanji not seen in MCI or controls, and both MCI and AD showing deficits in written narrative construction (Hayashi et al., 2015).","AD, MCI, DLB",Language
Dexterity,"Limb apraxia is more common in AD (including logopenic PPA and Posterior Cortical Atrophy variants) than in FTD associated disorders (bvFTD, svFTD, PNFA) with good discrimination (Ahmed et al., 2016). There is evidence to suggest that manual dexterity tests such as the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT) also have predictive power for the development of neurodegenerative conditions including AD, other dementias, PD, and PDD (Darweesh et al., 2017). Reduced scores are seen in MCI and AD (Aggarwal et al., 2006). DLB patients performed poorer a 9-hole peg test (9HP) than either PD or AD, with PD patients additionally outperforming those with AD (Fritz et al., 2016). Fine motor control in these tests becomes apparent before deficits in gross motor skills (Kluger et al., 1997). In individuals with PD, poor scores on pegboard and rhythmic finger-tapping tasks are predictive of the development of PDD (Anang, Gagnon and Bertrand, 2014). de Paula et al. (2016) found an association between cognitive test performance and fine motor control (9HP) for AD and aMCI patients which they further linked to their ability to perform daily living tasks.  

Drawing and writing ability is also impaired in cases of deteriorating fine motor control with AD patients reported to produce irregular, inaccurate handwriting performance compared to controls (Slavin et al., 1999; Schröter et al., 2003) deterioration is also seen in MCI, but the two groups can be separated by increasing task complexity (Schröter et al., 2003). In handwriting tasks movement produced by MCI and AD individuals is slower, less smooth and less consistent, with AD individuals producing more “jerky” movements than MCI (Yan et al., 2008). AD patients were less consistent in the letter shapes they produced in comparison to PD or HD (Huntington’s disease) groups. (Slavin et al., 1999). Speed and accuracy on a task where participants were asked to move a courser to a target on screen were reduced in AD patients, with poorer scores associated with worse attention and working memory scores, and with increasing disease progression (Ghilardi et al., 1999). Attentional differences may influence reaction times and therefor some measures of dexterity (Bangert and Balota, 2012).","AD, lvPPA, PCA, bvFTD, svFTD, PNFA, MCI, PD, PDD",Fine Motor Control
Rhythmic control,"Self-generated or spontaneous rhythmic finger-tapping rate also decreases with age (Baudouin, Vanneste and Isingrini, 2004) however, several differences distinct from the aging process have been associated with dementia. MCI, AD and PD patents had higher IIV (inter individual variability) finger tapping test with AD and MCI producing fewer taps, longer intervals, and PD patients the reverse (Roalf et al., 2018). The IIV metric appears to remain stable until it increases in later life, although differences can be observed in midlife in performance on complex tasks (Bielak et al., 2014).  Differences in the IIV (inter individual variability) of directed finger-tapping was found between cognitively normal adults and cognitively normal APOE-ε4 carriers compared to APOE-ε4 carriers with MCI (Kay et al., 2017). This test could not, however, discriminate between cognitively normal APOE-ε4 carriers and non-carriers which is apparent when using traditional cognitive testing (Kay et al., 2017).  

Bailon et al. (2010) also found reduced finger-tapping performance in AD along with other measures of psychomotor performance, however they found that finger-tapping performance was conserved for MCI and DLB individuals. There is also some evidence that FTD patients experience slower psychomotor performance than in AD (Walker et al., 2005). However, slowed psychomotor speeds are associated with a subset of FTD patients who parkinsonism in combination with the more typical behavioural or linguistic features (Padovani et al., 2007). 

Duchek, Balota and Ferraro (1994) report an impairment in rhythmic timekeeping in the finger tapping task for AD patients. Rhythmic impairment was also found in (Suzumura et al., 2016) in addition to a correlation between impairments on a finger-to-thumb tapping test and score on the MMSE for AD and MCI individuals, with effects pronounced in the non-dominant hand. The length of spontaneous tap, and the variability of tapping were found to correlate with MMSE (Rabinowitz and Lavner, 2014) and MoCA scores (Hu et al., 2014). However, Camarda et al. (2007) found no correlation between MMSE and motor function on a visual pointing task in AD. ","MCI, AD, PD, FTD, DLB",Fine Motor Control
BPV,"Studies focusing specifically on the variability of blood pressure as a risk factor (BPV) measured from visit-to-visit by a clinician support this link. A Japanese cohort of 1674 (194 of which developed dementia in follow up) took daily BP measurements at home, with higher CoV (coefficient of variation) of SBP presenting as a risk factor, and showing that short term variability is present in addition to long term visit-to-visit variability (Oishi et al., 2017). Joas et al. (2012) found low baseline systolic blood pressure with a steep increase in midlife to be predictive of AD in women followed from mid to later-life. A study of 3703 Japanese-American men found that increased mid-life SBP and DBP were risk factors, but that this risk disappeared in the population treated for hypertension (Launer et al., 2000), a previous study of 189 individuals from the same cohort found midlife SBP and DBP but not PP to be a predictor of dementia (Freitag et al., 2005). (Liang et al., 2018) also found increased risk for individuals with hypertension or elevated SBP/DBP.  
Pulse Pressure (AD) 

There is evidence for (Qiu et al., 2003) and against (Freitag et al., 2005) PP as a predictor for dementia. Although markers of cerebral small vessel disease and arterial stiffness were found to be linked to cognitive impairment in a 2015 metanalysis, PP was not found to be a consistent marker of this effect (Van Sloten et al., 2015). However, PP, increased P-tau in CSF, and reduced Aβ1-42 levels correlate in cognitively normal individuals in their 50s or 60s, consistent with the finding that midlife hypertension correlates with the incidence of neurofibrillary tangles and Aβ plaques, and suggesting that changes in PP may affect the clearance of Aβ plaques (Nation et al., 2013). Overall, mid to late life blood pressure is an established risk factor for dementia which could be developed into a useful biomarker when combined with other metrics.",AD,Blood Pressure
Threshold detection,"Here, specific odorants stimulating only the 1st cranial nerve without irritating trigeminal endings were used. The testing kit used here comprises of a series of dilutions of phenylethyl alcohol along with a solution containing only distilled water.

Participation,"The social activity of individuals prior to developing clinical dementia is of interest primarily due to amount of data now generated by individuals using social media and location services. Access to this data would allow for analysis of changes in activity, distances and frequency of travel, and size of social network. However, Public Health England noted in their review of primary prevention in dementia that there are insufficient studies investigating the effects of social activity in midlife on late-life dementia risk (Read et al., 2017). Although the effects of social activity in midlife are still unclear, the link between cognitive decline and social activity is more established in late life; questions about withdrawal from social activities are included in dementia assessment questionnaires (Maki and Yamaguchi, 2014) for complex reasons. 

The environments that dementia patients are comfortable navigating on their own become increasingly restricted as their disease progresses for several complex factors (Duggan et al., 2008). These include fear of getting lost, shrinking social networks, depression, or avoidance of people they knew so as not to draw attention to their condition (Duggan et al., 2008; Clarke and Bailey, 2016). As dementia progresses from MCI to moderate to severe, the ability to perform daily living tasks becomes progressively impaired (Giebel, Sutcliffe and Challis, 2015), these tasks are prerequisites for engaging in a rich social life such as bathing, getting dressed, or general self-organisation (Lam et al., 2015). This could result in a lack of social activity, and feelings of social isolation which are also considered a risk factor for developing dementia according to metanalysis by Kuiper et al. (2015).  

Declining social activity has been linked to dementia by several studies. Metanalysis by Fratiglioni, Paillard-borg and Winblad (2004) found 13 instances where studies reported a significant link between social activity (including size of social network, engaging in leisure activities, physical activity, and satisfaction with social life), and dementia risk, all involving individuals over the age of 65. Some of the strongest evidence for this effect were found in Scarmeas et al. (2001) where a 38% reduction in AD risk was found in the group dedicating a large part of their time to leisure activity, strikingly, were independent of baseline cognition, cardiovascular disease, depression, ethnicity, educational attainment, and occupation. Engagement in physical exercise has shown benefits for individuals with dementia, however activity levels extending beyond this to include the level of social activity is also associated with AD progression (Buchman et al., 2012). A broad range of different social activities is also considered beneficial (Karp et al., 2006; Lam et al., 2015). 

A 2010 longitudinal study found that individuals with a rich social life displayed higher baseline cognitive performance, however, this did not appear to be associated with cognitive decline (Marioni et al., 2010). Adults with higher occupational or educational attainment tend to have a later dementia onset, and a more rapid decline once symptoms present than their peers with lower qualifications (Stern, 2012). This may represent a stronger ability for the brain to compensate for lost functions, the concept of cognitive reserve, with symptoms only displaying at a late stage in progression as reviewed in Stern (2012). Although these factors raise problems with this metric for early detection of dementia, assessment of midlife intellectual and social stimulation may allow for the prediction of the pattern of decline expected.  

As far as early detection is concerned, the evidence for midlife social activity’s link to dementia still requires further clarification. Hwang, Park and Kim (2018) found that MMSE scores and participation in social activity showed no associated in midlife (below age 65) but decline in MMSE was associated with lower social contact after this point. Holtzman et al. (2004) did find an association with MMSE score for over 50s in a 12 year follow up period, however this group included a range of ages from 50-81 and so does not inform us about these effects specifically during midlife. Another study found that participation in any productive or social activity which would provide mental stimulation decreased risk of dementia as assessed on average 6 years prior to the diagnosis (Hui-Xin Wang et al., 2002). Looking at male twins discordant for dementia Carlson et al. (2008) found that activities which combine social and cognitive stimulation to be protective against AD. Although overall physical activity did not seem to bear any effect, particularly for those with underlying genetic risk, suggesting that there is a protective aspect in engaging with mentally stimulating social experiences beyond just living an active lifestyle in midlife (Carlson et al., 2008). Whilst changes in social activity are frequent in dementia sufferers, there is a lack of evidence to support the detection of these changes far before disease onset.","Generic, MCI, AD",Social Activity 
Social network size,"The size of the social network may also provide protective effects against dementia symptoms; however, these effects could result from stress protection as contacts provide emotional support, cognitive stimulation, or increase the individuals’ opportunity to engage with a broad range of stimulating activities (Holtzman et al., 2004). The size of a social network may not be protective against dementia with Green, Rebok and Lyketsos (2008) suggesting that social isolation may be instead responsible for a faster decline.",Generic,Social Activity 
Changes in social behaviour,"There may be further changes observable in dementia patients during social interactions, particularly in subtypes with behavioural factors. bvFTD can be distinguished from AD easily by observing interactions between the patient and others in their home environment, with a loss of expected manners, tact, and relation to others (for example using statements involving “you”) (Mendez et al., 2014). Behavioural symptoms being some of the first to present in bvFTD (Desmarais et al., 2018). Although there is more overlap between the conditions, distinguishing bvFTD from PPA is also possible from the observation of patient interactions, and carer reports (Banks and Weintraub, 2008). However, often by the time these symptoms present neurological pathology; atrophy of the medial frontal lobes, and temporal neocortex, has already taken hold.","bvFTD, AD",Social Activity 
Changes in allocentric and egocentric navigation strategies,"Navigational abilities tend to decline with age with a general shift from allocentric (location of objects with respect to each other) to egocentric (location of objects with respect to the observer) navigational strategies (Colombo et al., 2017; Lester et al., 2017; Qing et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2017). Impairment in allocentric and egocentric navigational abilities have been well documented in AD as reviewed in (Serino et al., 2014) with defects showing early in Alzheimer’s-linked amnesiac MCI, particularly in allocentric tasks (Kalová et al., 2005; Hort et al., 2007; Laczó, Andel, Vlček, et al., 2010; Laczó, Andel, Vyhnalek, et al., 2010; Wood et al., 2016; Ruggiero, Iavarone and Iachini, 2017). Egocentric defects have also been reported for amnesiac MCI (Laczó, Andel, Vlček, et al., 2010; Laczó, Andel, Vyhnalek, et al., 2010). Increased dependency on egocentric navigation may reflect compensation for basal forebrain and hippocampal atrophy in AD (Parizkova et al., 2018).

Reports of ego/allocentric navigation deficits are less common in non-Alzheimer’s dementias. However, decline in spatial orientation abilities in VD has been reported (Coughlan et al., 2018). This decline is distinct from the AD profile as it is limited to egocentric deficits, likely resulting from visuospatial problems (Coughlan et al., 2018).","MCI, AD, VD",Navigation
Perception of orientation,"Alzheimer’s patients have been reported to struggle with disorientation. Yew et al. (2013) found that that performance on questions about temporal and geographical location was impaired in comparison to controls and bvFTD, where patients do not suffer from the same confusion. DLB patients are also less impaired in their perception of orientation than AD individuals (Tu et al., 2015; Scharre et al., 2016) but do show defects in spatial orientation tests in comparison to individuals with PDD (Takemoto et al., 2016). Although there is some evidence to suggest spatial orientation is impaired in VD (Coughlan et al., 2018) VD patients have also been shown to outperform AD patients on orientation questionnaires (Bowden, 1992; Raimondi et al., 2012; Gonçalves et al., 2015), with similar differences also observed when comparing AD to PDD (Bowden, 1992).","AD, bvFTD, DLB, PDD",Navigation
HRV,"Heartrate is modulated via the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and is therefore naturally variable in healthy individuals as a dynamic homeostasis is maintained, with factors such as age, sex, aerobic fitness and various pathologies affecting it (Almeida-Santos et al., 2016; Shaffer and Ginsberg, 2017). There are several parameters which can be used to measure heart rate variability (HRV). Several metrics are associated with the R-R interval (RRI) or the interval between each heartbeat; Standard Deviation Normal-Normal (SDNN) measures variability of RRI; Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) measures the successive differences in RRI; NN50 is the number of pairs of successive RRI differing by >50ms, with the pNN50 being the proportion of NN50 compared to total RRI. ULF (ultra-low frequency), VLF (very low frequency), LF (low frequency), and HF (high frequency) rhythms can also be analysed with the LF/HF ratio also used as a metric for variability designed to indicate parasympathetic/sympathetic nervous system dominance.

Although HRV appeals due to its ease of measurement the only metanalysis of HRV on cognitive decline indicates that results are still inconclusive (da Silva et al., 2018) although a recent systematic review pointed to its use in predicting cognitive impairment in individuals without dementia or stroke (Carnevali et al., 2019) although this has been linked to level of education (Zeki Al Hazzouri et al., 2014). The evidence for HRV as a clear biomarker of dementia is still unclear, and furthermore excludes individuals with underlying cardiovascular conditions from testing limiting its suitability as a biomarker. However, its use as a supporting metric may still be viable. ","AD, DLB, FTD",Heart rate variability
Gustatory threshold,"Gustatory thresholds for the four basics tests (sweet, salty, sour and bitter) are performed using commercially available testing kits. These tastes can then be diluted to allow threshold testing, or a range of concentrations are already present in commercial kits. The subjects are then presented with these tastes and asked to state whether any taste is experienced and whether they can identify the taste, this allows ‘detection thresholds’ and ‘recognition thresholds’ to be identified.

Sweet and salty detection thresholds raised for Semantic dementia while total (including all four basic tastes). For recognition thresholds, they found sour, salty and total thresholds raised for both semantic dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia while bitter thresholds raised for semantic dementia.","AD, SD",Gustatory Function
