Sleep behaviour|Sleep is a part of everyday life; in fact, we would not be able to survive without it. It is a quintessential part of our health and for years it has been used to identify several neurological disorders. The sleep state involves vast numbers of complex interactions between many areas of the brain. As such, cognitive health can have a significant effect on sleep state. Studies have shown a notable difference between sleep profiles of healthy people and people living with dementia. Total duration of sleep has also been linked with risk of developing dementia. It was found that subjects who displayed a moderate to severe amount of reduction in sleep had a greater risk of developing all-cause dementia (Hahn et al., 2014). By observing the entire sleep profile, more distinct abnormal behaviours can be seen. These include sundowning and REM sleep behaviour disorder. Many of these observations are disease specific and are therefore important in understanding the differences between the dementia subtypes. Different subtypes affect different parts of the brain have different impacts on the same parts. These effects can be observed by looking at the difference in abnormalities as a total sleep profile. This type of comparison was performed successfully by a 2000 study by Grace JB, from which they highlighted the differences between sleep profiles in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). They found that DLB patients had a greater tendency to fall asleep in the day, experience more night-time disturbances due to bad dreams and RBD, and experienced confusion upon waking (Grace, Walker and McKeith, 2000). By looking at these behaviours it is possible to manifest a distinct profile which can be used to decide which dementia subtype a person is most at risk of developing.  Overall, sleep is a broad phenomenon to observe. From its vast number of characteristics, specific signatures have shown promise in detecting dementia. It is widely known that there are differences in sleep between healthy and demented individuals as well as between dementia subtypes, making it a potentially powerful, disease specific modality for early detection.
Cognition|DLB was found to exhibit lower SSDN, RMSSD, pNN50, VLF, LF, and total power than both controls and AD patients, and lower HF than AD patients alone (Kasanuki et al., 2015). Kasanuki et al. (2015) found no significant difference for LF/HF between AD and DLB patients, however Negami et al. (2013) found it to have 85% specificity and sensitivity and suggest that combining it with sympathetic skin response (SSR) could provide a sensitive assessment of the autonomic system in DLB. Comparison of MCI-DLB and MCI-AD individuals also found reduced SDNN, RMSSD, LF, HF, and total power in MCI-DLB with MCI-AD patients not differing significantly from controls with some correlation to neuropsychological test scores (Kim, Yoon and Hong, 2018). There is also some evidence that AD can be distinguished from bvFTD (Issac et al., 2017).
Gait|Gait dysfunction describes deviation from normal walking and is a part of the broader term of motor dysfunction which cover impairment in a range of motor skills. Gait is a complex locomotor process which incorporates input from various parts of the brain including cerebellum, motor cortex and the basal ganglia along with visual and vestibular senses (Valkanova and Ebmeier, 2017) The involvement of the neural cortex in gait is highlighted in dual task experiments where the hypothesis is that two simultaneously performed cognitive tasks can cause interference with each other if there is a reliance on the same subsystems in the brain. While this effect (drop in quality of task performance upon dual tasking) is observed in healthy adults too, it increases with both age and cognitive impairment (Verghese et al., 2007) and can thus be used to identify cognitive impairment when adjusting for age. A systematic review (Beauchet et al., 2016) provides evidence of poor gait performance being a predictor of dementia, especially non-AD and Vascular Dementia (VaD). The systematic review also shows gait being a more consistent and stronger predictor for non-AD dementias than AD dementia. There is evidence for poor motor performance, of which gait dysfunction is one, is both present many years before clinical symptoms of dementia and is caused by brain damage related to cognitive decline (Verghese et al., 2002). There is evidence (Verghese et al., 2002) that even after adjustment for other factors including demographics, medical histories and cognitive variables, elderly people with abnormal gait (amongst other cognitive features) are at an increased progression risk to dementia. Gait dysfunction is better at predicting non-AD dementias as compared to AD, and there is evidence (Tolea et al, 2016) that non-AD dementias in general and (VaD) are associated with a more rapid physical decline when compared with AD. These factors make gait a strong biomarker for early detection of non-AD dementia. 
Hearing|Hearing is one of the key senses used to experience the world. It is reliant on the sustained performance of mechanical body parts along with specific neuronal pathways. Impairment of this ability can be debilitating and cause problems for an individual. Specifically, hearing loss has been strongly linked to cognitive decline and may accelerate impairment (Gurgel et al., 2014). There have been many studies which have investigated the link between hearing and dementia, and a number of these have been able to identify specific behaviours and link them to their dementia subtypes as well as noting the potential for early diagnosis (Gurgel et al., 2014; Hardy et al., 2016).
Ocular function|The dementias are not traditionally seen as a disease of the eye, however many symptoms associated with visual functioning have been described. Changes in the visual system include, but are not limited to, visual acuity, colour vision, stereoacuity, contrast sensitivity, motion sensitivity, critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF) and visual attention as reviewed in (Armstrong and Kergoat, 2015). Additionally, reports of reading difficulties, and visual hallucinations are not uncommon in dementia sufferers. The underlying mechanisms causing visual problems in dementia patients is less well understood, with underlying changes in glucose metabolism (Kiyosa et al., 1989), structural changes within the eye (), and degeneration within the visual systems of the brain (Mittenberg, Choi and Apple, 2000). Although there are reports of altered physiology within the eye in dementia patients, there is little evidence to link these differences to the manifestation of visual processing defects (Friedman et al., 2002; Crow et al., 2003). Difficulties in separating these processing problems from each other (for example contrast sensitivity and acuity (Neargarder et al., 2003)), standardised testing, testing in such a way that cognitively impaired individuals can produce reliable results despite difficulties with communication or focus, and detection at an early stage still remain in this field. Differences in visual field perception have been reported in AD (Valenti, 2013). Individuals with DLB score worse on motion perception tests than AD patients (Calderon et al., 2001; Wood et al., 2013) 
EEG|Assessing activity within the brain gives may show early alterations indicative of dementia. One of the most direct and non-invasive methods for assessing this is via an electroencephalogram (EEG), measuring electrical activity through the scalp. Other techniques such as functional MRI, imaging the brains metabolism or blood flow as a proxy for neuronal activity, have also been established to provide insight. EEG has been used in the field of dementia for many years but has not yet matured sufficiently to produce a widely usable, pre-clinical diagnostic tool. Although precise (measuring within milliseconds) and non-invasive, EEG trades off some of the spatial resolution available in other scans such as MRI for higher temporal resolution (Al-Qazzaz et al., 2014). In diagnostics or clinical practice EEG’s tend to be visually interpreted, while research has moved towards quantitative EEG (qEEG) which requires more technical knowledge (Nardone et al., 2018). 
Mood|Mood is an important reflection of a person’s quality of life. It can tell us how a person is responding to the environment whilst also giving information about how healthy the brain is. Mood is an element said to be affected during neurodegeneration, particularly during dementia. There is a consensus that over the dementia subtypes the most common moods presented are negative or low emotions such as, depression, apathy and anxiety (McKeith and Cummings, 2005). In addition to this prevalence of low moods there has also been links relating them to increasing the risk of dementia development. This was observed in a study in 2019 by Sjöberg. They found that people with low moods who didn’t have a partner or lived alone had a higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia over a 9-year time span. They also stated that people who lived alone, even if they were in a relationship, had a 40% increased risk of developing dementia. They concluded that this increase was due to the low moods experienced by the participants (Sjöberg et al., 2019). This means that it is possible to suggest that mood may be an early indicator or predictor of dementia.
Language|The changes in how dementia patients understand and process speech, and the alterations in their speech patterns, vocabulary, and grammatical structure vary within and between dementia subtypes. AD and the Primary Progressive Aphasias (svFTD and PNFA associated with FTD pathology, and lvPPA (logopenic variant PPA) associated with AD) have the most clearly documented language phenotypes (Tang-Wai and Graham, 2008; Klimova and Semradova, 2016). Not only do linguistic difficulties impact the quality of life in dementia patients (Ferris and Farlow, 2013) impairment can predict mortality in AD (Cosentino et al., 2006).
Fine motor control|Fine motor control or manual dexterity and grip strength naturally declines with age, which can impact dally living tasks which are further impaired in individuals with MCI or dementia (as reviewed in Scherder, Dekker and Eggermont, 2008). The underlying mechanisms responsible for this observed difference are still unclear (Roalf et al., 2018). Underlying problems with motor planning have been observed in complex manual motor tasks, however this is not enough to explain other differences in speed and efficiency of movement compared to controls (Bellgrove et al., 1997). Slowing of reaction time has also been demonstrated in aMCI with increasing impairment in AD which also contributes to reduced performance on motor tasks (Gorus et al., 2008). Extensive AD pathology has been found in the primary motor cortex of patients, including senile plaque accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles which is evident in both early and late stages of the disease (Golaz, Bouras and Hof, 1992; Suva et al., 1999). Tau and Aβ aggregation have also been demonstrated in the 3xTg-AD mouse model (Orta-Salazara, Feria-Velascob and Díaz-Cintra, 2017). The distribution of neurofibrillary tangles may distinguish AD variants with Corticobasal syndrome patients exhibiting accumulation in the motor cortex in comparison to lvPPA and Alzheimer type (Petersen et al., 2019). Differences in the excitability of the motor cortex have been identified via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in AD (Alagona et al., 2001; Liepert et al., 2001; Pennisi et al., 2002; Alagona et al., 2004; Khedr et al., 2011; Ferreri et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) and similarly in VD (Alagona et al., 2004), although bvFTD patients do not appear to share this pathology (Wang et al., 2016). Abnormalities in the connectivity present in the motor cortex of AD have also been noted, with some features distinct from MCI (Ebadi et al., 2017).  
Navigation|Navigation requires several different cognitive processes which are affected in dementia. There are many types of navigational neurones which are found in the hippocampus, an area particularly vulnerable to degeneration in dementia (Hartley, Lever, Burgess, & O’keefe, 2013). Alzheimer’s patients have deficits in cognitive map formation (Allison et al., 2016) which are correlated to specific changes in brain physiology (for a review see Vlček and Laczó, 2014). Planning and executive functions, visual difficulties (discussed in section X (Ocular Function)), and general decline in memory likely contribute to navigational difficulties experienced in dementia (Coughlan et al., 2019). These navigational changes have been reported prior to dementia onset giving this modality potential as an early biomarker, although more research is needed on dementias other than AD, and the progression of MCI into different dementia subtypes.
Blood pressure variability|Blood pressure (BP) is a measure of the force generated by the heart’s contraction. It can be separated into Systolic (SBP) and Diastolic (DBP) measurements. The difference between SBP and DBP is referred to as the Pulse Pressure (PP). The link between cardiovascular health and cognitive decline is one of the better lifestyle predictors for dementia (Xu et al., 2015; Iadecola et al., 2016). 2011 metanalysis of 18 publications found weak and mixed results although midlife hypertension in DBP was considered adverse (Power et al., 2011). A metanalysis of 21 studies was more confident finding SBPs between 110-120mmHG protective in 62-82-year olds but SBPs above 162mmHg carrying an increased risk in 70-87-year age range (Xu, 2018). Overall there is now good evidence to support mid- late-life hypertension as a risk factor for dementia (McGrath et al., 2017; Lane et al., 2019)
Olfactory function|"Olfactory disorders in AD are caused by amyloid plaques in olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and associated limbic regions such as uncus and amygdala (Gros et al., 2017). Olfactory dysfunction has potential as a clinical biomarker and is currently underutilised as cognitive and imaging tests are more commonly used however currently there is no gold standard of olfactory testing to diagnose or monitor AD. Studies have shown that in up to 90% of patients with idiopathic PD (Parkinson’s disease), there is olfactory dysfunction (Domellöf et al., 2017). The study by Domellöf et al., 2017 did a 10-year follow up study at multiple time intervals with olfactory function measurement using B-SIT (brief smell identification test) in 125 patients diagnosed with PD. The B-SIT uses a booklet contains 12 strips with a range of scents used to test olfactory function.  Over 10 years, 46% of patients with olfactory dysfunction at baseline developed dementia, compared with 21% of patients with no diagnosed olfactory dysfunction at baseline. The study shows impairment of olfactory detection leading to a significant increase in risk of developing PDD. 

While a clinical diagnosis of DLB (dementia with Lewy bodies) is challenging at any stage due to not all patients displaying all of core clinical features along with the overlap with AD. (Han Yoon et al., 2015) This leads to DLB being frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as AD. DLB was diagnosed using the 2005 revised criterion while AD was diagnosed using NINCDS/ADRDA criterion. The study by Han Yoon et al. showed MCI-BLB patients to have greater impairments in olfactory function as measured by the CCSI (cross-cultural smell identification test) along with frontal-executive and visuospatial function impairments when compared with MCI-AD patients showing the potential for olfactory function as a useful biomarker for diagnosis and identification of DLB in combination with other clinical tools.  

Olfactory function can be tested using four types of tests: odour threshold, odour discrimination, odour memory and odour identification (Albers, Tabert and Devanand, 2006). The same study showed that both odour detection thresholds and odour identification are both reduced in patients with an increased risk for developing dementia. While the degree of olfactory dysfunction is similar, the temporal relationship varies with the rate of dysfunction being accelerated in disorders associated with Lewy bodies. There are also reports of the presence of Lewy bodies being correlated with earlier and more profound olfactory deficit. Odour identification and odour discrimination are more severely impaired than odour detection. A potential explanation for this is the requirement for complex processing in odour discrimination as opposed to odour identification. 

Olfactory dysfunction is considered a clinical correlate of the most types of dementia along with mild cognitive impairment. Also, pathological protein aggregates appear to affect olfactory regions before other regions suggesting a vulnerability of the olfactory system to neurodegeneration. Impairment of olfactory function has a negative impact on the quality of life as its effects enjoyment of food, leads to challenges with maintaining personal hygiene, impairs ability to sense warning odours etc (Marin et al., 2018). Approximately 85% of patients with early stage AD show olfactory impairment with the development occurring before cognitive impairment signs are apparent (Serby, Larson and Kalkstein, 1991).  

Despite longitudinal studies showing reduced olfactory identification predicting faster cognitive decline in patients in with MCI and AD, olfactory dysfunction in AD patients is regularly undiagnosed. Patients with MCI and low olfactory function have been proposed to be more likely to develop AD, especially those with unawareness of lack of problems with their sense of smell (Devanand et al., 2000), raising the importance of incorporating regular checks for this biomarker. A 2-year follow up study showed 47% of MCI patients with olfactory impairment and 11% of MCI patients with normal sense of smell leading to AD development (Conti et al., 2013). When combined with verbal memory, hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex volume testing, olfactory function testing has a strong predictive value for MCI to AD conversion (90% specificity and 85.2% sensitivity) in a 3-year follow up study (Devanand et al., 2008). "
Social activity|There is increasing evidence that social activity is linked to cognitive decline in dementia. There are still many outstanding questions before it develops as a predictor. Is social activity protective of cognitive decline, or is lack of it damaging, and what social activities are the most relevant to changes in dementia progression? Bidzan, Bidzan and Pąchalska (2016) propose that clinical assessment of the physical and social activities of individuals with MCI has potential for predicting the likelihood of progression to dementia. But yet there is little evidence that social activity, or the size of social networks, would be helpful for distinguishing dementia subtypes from each other. Early behavioural symptoms impacting social interactions are present in some cases of dementia, particularly in bvFTD. Although these behavioural changes can distinguish AD from bvFTD (Mendez et al., 2014), this is after clinical dementia is present, limiting its use as an early biomarker. 
Heart rate variability|Heartrate is modulated via the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and is therefore naturally variable in healthy individuals as a dynamic homeostasis is maintained, with factors such as age, sex, aerobic fitness and various pathologies affecting it (Almeida-Santos et al., 2016; Shaffer and Ginsberg, 2017). There are several parameters which can be used to measure heart rate variability (HRV). Several metrics are associated with the R-R interval (RRI) or the interval between each heartbeat; Standard Deviation Normal-Normal (SDNN) measures variability of RRI; Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) measures the successive differences in RRI; NN50 is the number of pairs of successive RRI differing by >50ms, with the pNN50 being the proportion of NN50 compared to total RRI. ULF (ultra-low frequency), VLF (very low frequency), LF (low frequency), and HF (high frequency) rhythms can also be analysed with the LF/HF ratio also used as a metric for variability designed to indicate parasympathetic/sympathetic nervous system dominance. Although HRV appeals due to its ease of measurement the only metanalysis of HRV on cognitive decline indicates that results are still inconclusive (da Silva et al., 2018) although a recent systematic review pointed to its use in predicting cognitive impairment in individuals without dementia or stroke (Carnevali et al., 2019) although this has been linked to level of education (Zeki Al Hazzouri et al., 2014). The evidence for HRV as a clear biomarker of dementia is still unclear, and furthermore excludes individuals with underlying cardiovascular conditions from testing limiting its suitability as a biomarker. However, its use as a supporting metric may still be viable. 
Gustatory function|On top of olfactory impairment, there is limited evidence which suggests a link between gustatory impairment and dementia. A cohort study (Lang et al., 2006) found a correlation between dementia severity and gustatory dysfunction with special prominence in PD patients even after accounting for age, smoking and alcohol consumption. Further to this, another cohort study (Steinbach et al., 2010) showed gustatory impairment being associated with MCI and AD patients when compared with control subjects while there being no difference significant between MCI and AD patients. A study by (Ogawa et al., 2017) shows that while AD is pathologically characterised by loss of neurons and is thought to affect taste cortex as well, there are limited reports on gustatory function in AD with the reports being inconsistent. This study looked at 22 subjects with mild-to-moderately severe DA and 49 controls (further split into 2 age groups with the higher age group mean age being equal to the AD group mean age. They found gustatory function to be significantly impaired in AD when compared with age-matched controls however no significant differences were found between the younger and older control groups. Electrogustometric thresholds however showed no difference between AD and age-matched controls.
